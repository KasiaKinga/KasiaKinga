<!--   <pre align="left"> -->
 <p align="left">
  I'm a freshly trained software engineer with an industrial design background. <br>I love learning technologies and tools in order to build or improve things.

As an industrial designer I worked in the end-to-end development process, created objects that people use in everyday life, <br>and utilized various tools / machines to build prototypes for user testing.</pre>
  

  As a software engineer my main tools are JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, PosgtreSQL, HTML, and CSS.
  I’m especially enjoying building user-facing apps which are interactive, intuitive, responsive and accessible.

<samp>Hi, I'm Kasia 👋 I'm a freshly trained software engineer with industrial design background. What it really means, I love learning technologies and tools in order to build or improve things.</samp>

<samp> As an industrial designer I worked in cross functional teams in the end-to-end development process of creating objects that people use in everyday life :chair: 	:house: 🚙. In order to implement the idea, I used various tools and machines to build prototypes and than test them with the user to collect the feedback (so called UX). </samp>
