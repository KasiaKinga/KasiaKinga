 <h3><samp>hello, I'm Kasia 👋</samp></h3>
<samp>
  I'm a freshly trained software engineer with an industrial design background <br>who loves learning technologies and tools in order to build or improve things.
 
 <br>As an industrial designer I worked in the end-to-end development process, <br>created objects that people use in everyday life, and utilized various tools / machines<br> to build prototypes for user testing.

  As a software engineer I’m especially enjoying building user-facing apps which are<br> **interactive**, **intuitive**, **responsive**, **accessible**<br>

<samp>Hi, I'm Kasia 👋 I'm a freshly trained software engineer with industrial design background. What it really means, I love learning technologies and tools in order to build or improve things.</samp>

<samp> As an industrial designer I worked in cross functional teams in the end-to-end development process of creating objects that people use in everyday life :chair: 	:house: 🚙. In order to implement the idea, I used various tools and machines to build prototypes and than test them with the user to collect the feedback (so called UX). </samp>
  
 
<samp>As a software engineer my main tools are ``JavaScript``, ``React``, ``Redux``, ``Node.js``, ``PosgtreSQL``, ``HTML``, ``CSS``. I’m especially enjoying building user-facing apps which are interactive, intuitive, responsive and accessible.</samp>
